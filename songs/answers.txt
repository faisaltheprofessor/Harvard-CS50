1: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

SELECT AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(loudness), AVG(speechiness), AVG(valence), AVG(tempo), AVG(duration_ms) FROM songs;

+-------------------+-------------+---------------+------------------+--------------+------------+------------------+
| avg(danceability) | avg(energy) | avg(loudness) | avg(speechiness) | avg(valence) | avg(tempo) | avg(duration_ms) |
+-------------------+-------------+---------------+------------------+--------------+------------+------------------+
| 0.71646           | 0.65906     | -5.67764      | 0.115569         | 0.484443     | 119.90418  | 205206.78        |
+-------------------+-------------+---------------+------------------+--------------+------------+------------------+

- Based on these values I can say the person prefers songs that make them dance and give them energy.



2: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
I am not sure since I am not a music guy. :)
