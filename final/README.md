# Portfolio web app + iOS App
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/BPk4mw-FVf8
#### Description:
- This project consists of two parts:
    - Web Application
    - iOS app
- The web application utilizes Laravel, designed to showcase my portfolio. Within this platform,  visitor information is captured and stored. Visitors can use the contact form to send messages.
- Furthermore, I have extended the functionality of this project by developing an iOS application that interfaces with the web platform. The app enables users to access and retrieve visitor information along with messages from the website.
