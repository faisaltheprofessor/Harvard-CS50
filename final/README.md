# Portfolio web app + iOS App
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/BPk4mw-FVf8
#### Description:
- I have crafted a dynamic and interactive web application utilizing Laravel, designed to showcase my portfolio. Within this platform, valuable visitor information is captured and stored, enriching the user experience and facilitating engagement. Visitors have the opportunity to seamlessly communicate by utilizing the contact form to send messages, fostering interaction and connection.
Furthermore, I have extended the functionality of this project by developing an iOS application that interfaces with the web platform. This innovative mobile app enables users to access and retrieve visitor information along with messages from the website, ensuring a consistent and cohesive experience across multiple devices. Through this integrated approach, I have created a synergistic ecosystem that enhances user engagement and leverages the power of modern web and mobile technologies.
